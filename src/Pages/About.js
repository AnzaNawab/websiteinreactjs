                    <p> There's this notion that to grow a business, 
                    you have to be ruthless. But we know there's a better 
                    way to grow. One where what's good for the bottom line
                     is also good for customers. We believe businesses can
                      grow with a conscience, and succeed with a soul â€” and 
                      that they can do it with inbound. That's why we've created 
                      a platform uniting software, education, and community to help
                       businesses grow better every day.</p>
